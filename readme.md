# Implementing Sorting Algorithms in Javascript

## Part 1: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort

Try to implement bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort (if you need a refresher on these algorithms, check out the [computer science curriculum](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-2/04-sorting-intro.md)).

For each of these algorithms, you'll also find it helpful to implement a `swap` function which swaps to values in an array. 

Your goal is to get the tests for `bubbleSort`, `selectionSort`, `insertionSort`, and `swap` to pass. Note: The tests for the three searching algorithms are the same, but don't use the same implementation for each! The goal of this exercise is for you to be able to implement the different algorithms, even though they have the same effect on the arrays in the tests.

## Part 2: Merge Sort, Quicksort

Try to implement two more advanced sorting algorithms: merge sort and quicksort (if you need a refresher, check out the [computer science curriculum](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-3/01-sorting-revisited.md)).

For merge sort, you'll find it helpful to implement a `merge` function which takes two sorted arrays and merges them into one sorted array. 

Your goal is to get the tests for `mergeSort`, `quickSort`, and `merge` to pass. Note: As in Part 1, don't use the same implementations for these searching algorithms!
